What is required per MS docs

Preparation steps, ensuring all storage systems drivers, network drivers are up to date. Performance benchmarks should be obtained prior (7 days ideally, but 24 hours suffices).

Ensuring either the distro or kernel is supported. As well as the file system (supported file systems are in the aforementioned link).

Kernel Reqs: fanotify must be enabled. Third party Avs must be removed prior as it will cause conflicts/locks on fanotify resources.
•	Audit framework (auditd) must be enabled. Custom rules for Auditd can cause issues too.

•	The mdatp RPM package requires "glibc >= 2.17", "audit", "policycoreutils", "semanage" "selinux-policy-targeted", "mde-netfilter" 
•	For RHEL6 the mdatp RPM package requires "audit", "policycoreutils", "libselinux", "mde-netfilter" 
•	For DEBIAN the mdatp package requires "libc6 >= 2.23", "uuid-runtime", "auditd", "mde-netfilter" 
 
The mde-netfilter package also has the following package dependencies: 
•	For DEBIAN the mde-netfilter package requires "libnetfilter-queue1", "libglib2.0-0" 
•	For RPM the mde-netfilter package requires "libmnl", "libnfnetlink", "libnetfilter_queue", "glib2"
